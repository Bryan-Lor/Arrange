## 
I developed Arrange as a personal project to organize my tasks while gaining expertise in HTML DOM manipulation. In the process, I gained valuable insights into the benefits of using React for dynamic DOM updates over manual handling. This project was also deployed on Netlify for easy access.
  
**Lessons Learned:**
- Creating Single Page Applications
- Generating/Manipulating DOMs
- Handling LocalStorage
- Deploying Apps on Netlify
