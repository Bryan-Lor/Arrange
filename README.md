Arrange is a client-side web application that allows users to map projects with their respective tasks. Its purpose is to streamline productivity by simplifying the process of getting things done.

## 
Originally I wanted an application to organize my projects and further streamline productivity. This led to the creation of Arrange, which proved to be a great programming exercise. I have structured the project to use vanilla JavaScript to expand my knowledge of React and how it speeds the development process. The entire application is linked and deployed on Netlify.  
  
**Lessons Learned:**
- Creating Single Page Applications
- Generating/Manipulating DOMs
- Handling LocalStorage
- Deploying Apps on Netlify
