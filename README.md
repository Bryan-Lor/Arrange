Arrange is a client-side web application that allows users to map projects with their respective tasks. Its purpose is to streamline productivity by simplifying the process of getting things done.

## 
Originally I wanted to develop an application to organize my projects while learning HTML DOM manipulation. This led to the creation of Arrange, which proved to be a great learning experience. To expand my knowledge of React and how it dynamically updates DOM, I decided to structure the project to use only vanilla JavaScript. As a result, I learned that manually handling DOMs is a pain. I now understand why frameworks such as React are widely appreciated and utilized. Additionally, I have configured Arrange to be linked and deployed on Netlify. 
  
**Lessons Learned:**
- Creating Single Page Applications
- Generating/Manipulating DOMs
- Handling LocalStorage
- Deploying Apps on Netlify
